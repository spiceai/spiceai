# Explanation from: https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/0_intro_rl
#
# The DQN (Deep Q-Network) algorithm was developed by DeepMind in 2015. It was able to
# solve a wide range of Atari games (some to superhuman level) by combining reinforcement
# learning and deep neural networks at scale. The algorithm was developed by enhancing a
# classic RL algorithm called Q-Learning with deep neural networks and a technique called experience replay.
