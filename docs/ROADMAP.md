# Spice.ai Roadmap

This describes the current Spice.ai roadmap.

This is a living doc that will be updated based on community and customer feedback.

If you have a feature request or suggestion, please [get in touch](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai#community)!

## Current Limitations

Spice.ai is still under early development, so there are several gaps and limitations, including:

- Reward code must be written in Python 3. The plan is to enable these to be written in any language that compiles to Web Assembly.
- Running in Docker is required - a pure metal experience will be supported before v1.0 (possible now, but unsupported).
- Native support for macOS and Linux only. [WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) is required for Windows.
- darwin/arm64 is not yet supported (i.e. Apple's M1 Macs). We use M1s ourselves, so we hope to support this very soon üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª
