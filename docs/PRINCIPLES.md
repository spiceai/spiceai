# Spice.ai First Principles

Spice.ai is built upon a foundation of first principles.

## Summary

- Developer experience first
- Bring data and ML to your application
- First class extensibility

### Developer experience first

The goal of Spice.ai is to make creating intelligent applications as easy as possible, and so developer experience comes first

### Bring data and ML to your application

Instead of sending valuable application data into another service, bring data and ML as close to your application as possible. This supports the approach for the application and the ML engine to work together in the same data space, and to provide feedback to each other, for higher performance.

### First class extensibility

Spice.ai is designed to be extended. All components are behind well-defined interfaces, and new components can be added dynamically without code changes to the core project.
