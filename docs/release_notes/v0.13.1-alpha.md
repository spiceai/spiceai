# Spice v0.13.1-alpha (May 27, 2024)

The v0.13.1-alpha release of Spice is a minor update focused on stability, quality, and operability. Query result caching provides protection against bursts of queries and recent queries are logged in the `spice.runtime.query_history` dataset. Schema support for datasets has been added logical grouping. An issue where Refresh SQL predicates were not pushed down underlying data sources has been resolved along with improved Acceleration Refresh logging.

## Highlights in v0.9.1-alpha

- **Results Caching:** Introduced query results caching to handle bursts of requests and support caching of non-accelerated results, such as refresh data returned [on zero results](https://docs.spiceai.org/data-accelerators/data-refresh#behavior-on-zero-results). Results caching is enabled by default with a `1s` item time-to-live (TTL). [Learn more](https://docs.spiceai.org/features/caching).

- **Query History Logging:** Recent queries are now logged in the new `spice.runtime.query_history` dataset with a default retention of 24-hours.

- **Dataset Schemas:** Added support for dataset schemas, allowing logical grouping of datasets by separating the schema name from the table name with a `.`. E.g.

  ```yaml
  datasets:
    - from: mysql:app1.identities
      name: app.users

    - from: postgres:app2.purchases
      name: app.purchases
  ```

  In this example, queries against `app.users` will be federated to `my_schema.my_table`, and `app.purchases` will be federated to `app2.purchases`.
