# Spice v0.15-alpha (July 1, 2024)

The v0.15.1-alpha focuses on stability, performance, and usability improvements in the Spice runtime. Improved runtime memory usage when accelerating large datasets with the `postgres` and `duckdb` engines by reading data from the source and writing to the accelerated table simultaneously, without collecting all chunks in memory first.

**Improved memory usage with PostgreSQL and DuckDB acceleration**. The accelerated data refresh now uses a streaming approach to write data (only `postgres` and `duckdb` are currently supported), which writes new data directly once it is available without collecting all data in memory first.

**GraphQL object unnesting support**. The Spice runtime can now automatically unnest objects from GraphQL queries using the `unnest_depth` parameter.
