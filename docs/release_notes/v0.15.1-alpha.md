# Spice v0.15.1-alpha (July 8, 2024)

The v0.15.1-alpha minor release focuses on enhancing stability, performance, and usability. Memory usage has been significantly improved for the `postgres` and `duckdb` acceleration engines which now use stream processing. A new Delta Lake Data Connector has been added, sharing a [delta-kernel-rs](https://github.com/delta-incubator/delta-kernel-rs) based implementation with the Databricks Data Connector supporting [deletion vectors](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-deletion-vectors.html).

## Highlights

**Improved memory usage for PostgreSQL and DuckDB acceleration engines:** Large dataset acceleration with [PostgreSQL](https://docs.spiceai.org/data-accelerators/postgres) and [DuckDB](https://docs.spiceai.org/data-accelerators/duckdb) engines has reduced memory consumption by streaming data directly to the accelerated table as it is read from the source.

**Delta Lake Data Connector:** A new [Delta Lake Data Connector](https://docs.spiceai.org/data-connectors/delta-lake) has been added for using [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) outside of Databricks.

**ODBC Data Connector Streaming:** The [ODBC Data Connector](https://docs.spiceai.org/data-connectors/odbc) now streams results, reducing memory usage, and improving performance.

**GraphQL Object Unnesting:** The [GraphQL Data Connector](https://docs.spiceai.org/data-connectors/graphql) can automatically unnest objects from GraphQL queries using the `unnest_depth` parameter.
