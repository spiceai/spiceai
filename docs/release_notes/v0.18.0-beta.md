# Spice v0.18.0-beta (Sep 16, 2024)

The v0.18.0-beta release adds new Sharepoint and File data connectors, introduces AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) support for the S3 Data Connector, improves performance of the GitHub connector, and increases the overall reliability of all data accelerators. The `/ready` API endpoint was enhanced to report as ready only when all components, including loaded data, have successfully reported readiness.

## Highlights in v0.18.0-beta

**Sharepoint Data Connector**: Use `from: sharepoint:` to access and accelerate documents stored in Microsoft 365 OneDrive for Business (Sharepoint).

Example `spicepod.yml`:

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: sharepoint:drive:Documents/path:/important_documents/
    name: important_documents
    params:
      sharepoint_client_id: ${secrets:SPICE_SHAREPOINT_CLIENT_ID}
      sharepoint_tenant_id: ${secrets:SPICE_SHAREPOINT_TENANT_ID}
      sharepoint_client_secret: ${secrets:SPICE_SHAREPOINT_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

See the [Sharepoint Data Connector documentation](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/data-connectors/postgres).

**AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for S3**: A new `s3_auth` parameter for the `s3` data connector to configure the authentication method to use when connecting to S3. Supported values are `public`, `key`, and `iam_role`. Use `s3_auth: iam_role` to assume the instance IAM role.

Example `spicepod.yml`:

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: s3://my-bucket
    name: bucket
    params:
      s3_auth: iam_role # Assume IAM role of instance
```

See the [S3 Data Connector documentation](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/data-connectors/s3).

**File Data Connector** Use `from: file:` to query files stored by locally accessible filesystems.

Example `spicepod.yml`:

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: file://path/to/customer.parquet
    name: customer
    params:
      file_format: parquet
```

See the [File Data Connector documentation](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/data-connectors/file).

**Improved `/ready` Api** Now includes the initial data load in addition to component readiness to ensure readiness is only reported when data has loaded and can be successfully queried.

## Breaking Changes

- **Dataset Time Column Format:** The `time_format` value for [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) is now lowercase (`iso8601`) to be consistent with other values. Previously `ISO8601`. To upgrade, change uses of `time_format: ISO8601` to `time_format: iso8601`.

- **GitHub Data Connector:** The data type for time-related columns has changed from `Utf8` to `Timestamp`. To upgrade, data type references to timestamp. For example, if using `time_format:`, change uses of `time_format: ISO8601` to `time_format: timestamp`.

- **Ready API:** The `/ready` API reports ready only when all components have reported ready and data is fully loaded. To upgrade, evaluate uses of the Ready API (such as Kubernetes readiness probes) and consider how it might affect system behavior.
