# Spice v0.18.0-beta (Sep 16, 2024)

The v0.18.0-beta release brings significant improvements in performance for running accelerated queries across multiple datasets. It adds a `sharepoint` and `file` data connectors, introduces `iam_role` support for `s3` to utilize AWS instance metadata for assuming the instance IAM role, improves the robustness of the `github` connector, and increases the overall reliability of data accelerators. The `/ready` endpoint was enhanced to report as ready only when all components, including accelerated datasets with loaded data, have successfully reported their readiness.

## Highlights in v0.18.0-beta

**Enhanced Federation for Accelerated Queries**: Accelerated queries across PostgreSQL, SQLite in file mode, DuckDB in file mode now support federation, providing more efficient query execution.

**Sharepoint Data Connector**: Use `sharepoint` data conenctor to access and accelerate documents stored in Sharepoint

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: sharepoint:drive:Documents/path:/my_documents/
    name: important_documents
    params:
      sharepoint_client_id: ${secrets:SPICE_SHAREPOINT_CLIENT_ID}
      sharepoint_tenant_id: ${secrets:SPICE_SHAREPOINT_TENANT_ID}
      sharepoint_client_secret: ${secrets:SPICE_SHAREPOINT_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

**`s3_auth` parameter for `s3`**  Added `s3_auth` param that configures the authentication method to use when connecting to S3 buckets (`public`, `key`, `iam_role`). With `s3_auth: iam_role` the s3 connector will use the AWS metadata instance provider to assume the instance IAM role.

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: s3://my-bucket
    name: bucket
    params:
      s3_auth: iam_role
```

**File data connector** Use `file` data conenctor to query files stored by locally accessible filesystems.

``` yaml
datasets:
  - from: file://path/to/customer.parquet
    name: customer
    params:
      file_format: parquet
```

**Improved `/ready` Api**  Now reports ready only when all components, including accelerated datasets with loaded data, have successfully reported their readiness.

## Breaking Changes

- [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) `time_column` value changed to be lowercase: `iso8601` (previosly `ISO8601`)
- GitHub connector: type for time-related columns changed from `Utf8` to `Timestamp`
- Tweak `/ready` to only report ready when components have all reported Ready
- Name for Spcie.ai data connector changed from `spiceai` to `spice.ai` (in progress)
