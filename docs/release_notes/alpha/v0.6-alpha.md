# Spice.ai v0.6-alpha

Announcing the release of Spice.ai v0.6-alpha! üèπ

Spice.ai now scales to datasets 10-100 larger enabling new classes of uses cases and applications! üöÄ We've completely rebuilt Spice.ai's data processing and transport upon [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), a high-performance platform that uses an in-memory columnar format. Spice.ai joins other major projects including Apache Spark, pandas, and InfluxDB in being powered by Apache Arrow. This also paves the way for high-performance data connections to the Spice.ai runtime using Apache Arrow Flight and import/export of data using [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/). We're incredibly excited about the potential this architecture has for building intelligent applications on top of a high-performance transport between application data sources the Spice.ai AI engine.

## Highlights in v0.6-alpha

### Massive improvement in data loading performance and dataset scale

From [data connectors](https://github.com/spiceai/data-components-contrib/tree/trunk/dataconnectors), to [REST API](https://docs.spiceai.org/api/), to AI engine, we've now rebuilt Spice.ai's data processing and transport on the Apache Arrow project. Specifically, using the [Apache Arrow for Go](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/go) implementation. Many thanks to [Matt Topol](https://github.com/zeroshade) for his contributions to the project and guidance on using it.

This release includes a change to the Spice.ai runtime to AI Engine transport from sending text CSV over gGPC to Apache Arrow Records over IPC (Unix sockets).

This is a breaking change to the [Data Processor interface](https://github.com/spiceai/data-components-contrib/tree/trunk/dataprocessors#contribution-guide), as it now uses `arrow.Record` instead of `Observation`.

#### Benchmarking v0.6

Before v0.6, Spice.ai would not scale into the 100s of 1000s of rows.

| Format | Row Number | Data Size | Process Time | Load Time | Transport time | Memory Usage |
| ------ | ---------- | --------- | ------------ | --------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| csv    | 2,000      | 163.15KiB | 3.0005s      | 0.0000s   | 0.0100s        | 423.754MiB   |

After building on Arrow, Spice.ai now easily scales beyond millions of rows.
