# Spice v0.12.2-alpha (May 13, 2024)

The v0.12.2-alpha release introduces data streaming and key-pair authentication for the Snowflake data connector, enables general `append` mode data refreshes for time-series data, improves connectivity error messages, adds nested folders support for the S3 data connector, and exposes nodeSelector and affinity keys in the Helm chart for better Kubernetes management.

## Highlights

- **Improved Connectivity Error Messages**: Error messages provide clearer, actionable guidance for misconfigured settings or unreachable data connectors.

- **Snowflake Data Connector Improvements**: Enables data streaming by default and adds support for [key-pair](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth) authentication in addition to passwords.

- **API for Refresh SQL Updates**: Update dataset Refresh SQL via API.

- **Append Data Refresh**: Append mode data refreshes for time-series data are now supported for all data connectors. Specify a dataset `time_column` with `refresh_mode: append` to only fetch data more recent than the latest local data.

- **Docker Image Update**: The `spiceai/spiceai:latest` Docker image now includes the ODBC data connector. For a smaller footprint, use `spiceai/spiceai:latest-slim`.

- **Helm Chart Improvements**: `nodeSelector` and `affinity` keys are now supported in the Helm chart for improved Kubernetes deployment management.

## Breaking Changes

- API to trigger accelerated dataset refreshes has changed from `POST /v1/datasets/:name/refresh` to `POST /v1/datasets/:name/acceleration/refresh` to be consistent with the `Spicepod.yaml` structure.
