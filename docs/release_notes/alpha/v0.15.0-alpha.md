# Spice v0.15-alpha (July 1, 2024)

The v0.15-alpha release introduces support for streaming databases changes with Change Data Capture (CDC) into accelerated tables via a new Debezium connector, configurable retry logic for data refresh, and the release of a new C# SDK to build with Spice in Dotnet.

## Highlights

- **Debezium data connector with Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Sync accelerated datasets with Debezium data sources over Kafka in real-time.

- **Data Refresh Retries:** By default, accelerated datasets attempt to retry data refreshes on transient errors. This behavior can be configured using `refresh_retry_enabled` and `refresh_retry_max_attempts`.

- **C# Client SDK:** A new [C# Client SDK](https://github.com/spiceai/spice-dotnet/releases/tag/v0.1.0) has been released for developing applications in Dotnet.

### Debezium data connector with Change Data Capture (CDC)

Integrating Debezium CDC is straightforward. Get started with the [Debezium CDC Sample](https://github.com/spiceai/samples/tree/trunk/cdc-debezium), read more about [CDC](https://docs.spiceai.org/features/cdc) in Spice, and read the [Debezium data connector documentation](https://docs.spiceai.org/data-connectors/debezium).

Example Spicepod using Debezium CDC:

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: debezium:cdc.public.customer_addresses
    name: customer_addresses_cdc
    params:
      debezium_transport: kafka
      debezium_message_format: json
      kafka_bootstrap_servers: localhost:19092
    acceleration:
      enabled: true
      engine: duckdb
      mode: file
      refresh_mode: changes
```

### Data Refresh Retries

Example Spicepod configuration limiting refresh retries to a maximum of 10 attempts:

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: eth.blocks
    name: blocks
    acceleration:
      refresh_retry_enabled: true
      refresh_retry_max_attempts: 10
      refresh_check_interval: 30s
```
