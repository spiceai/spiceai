# Spice v0.13.2-alpha (June 3, 2024)

The v0.13.2-alpha release is focused on quality and stability with improvements to federated query push-down, telemetry, and query history.

## Highlights

- **Filesystem Data Connector:** Adds the Filesystem Data Connector for directly using files as data sources.

- **Federated Query Push-Down:** Improved stability and schema compatibility for federated queries.

- **Enhanced Telemetry:** Runtime Metrics now include last update time for accelerated datasets, count of refresh errors, and new metrics for query duration and failures.

- **Query History:** Enabled query history logging for Arrow Flight queries in addition to HTTP queries.
