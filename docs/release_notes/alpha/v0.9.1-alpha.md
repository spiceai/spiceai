# Spice v0.9.1-alpha

The v0.9.1 release focused on stability, bug fixes, and usability by adding `spice` CLI commands for listing Spicepods (`spice pods`), Models (`spice models`), Datasets (`spice datasets`), and improved status (`spice status`) details. In addition, the Arrow Flight SQL (`flightsql`) data connector and SQLite (`sqlite`) data store were added.

## Highlights in v0.9.1-alpha

**FlightSQL data connector**: [Arrow Flight SQL](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/FlightSql.html) can now be used as a connector for federated SQL query.

**SQLite data backend**: [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) can now be used as a data store for acceleration.
