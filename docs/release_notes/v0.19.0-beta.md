# Spice v0.19.0-beta (Oct 7, 2024)

Spice v0.19.0-beta brings performance improvements for accelerators and expanded TPC-DS coverage. A new Azure Blob Storage data connector has also been added.

## Highlights in v0.19.0-beta

**Improved TPC-DS Coverage**: Enhanced support for TPC-DS derived queries.

**CLI SQL REPL**: The CLI SQL REPL (`spice sql`) now supports multi-line editing and tab indentation. Note, a terminating semi-colon ';' is now required for each executed SQL block.

**Azure Storage Data Connector**: A new Azure Blob Storage data connector (`abfs://`) has been added, enabling federated SQL queries on files stored in Azure Blob-compatible endpoints, including Azure BlobFS (`abfss://`) and Azure Data Lake (`adl://`). Supported file formats can be specified using the `file_format` parameter.

Example `spicepod.yml`:

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: abfs://foocontainer/taxi_sample.csv
    name: azure_test
    params:
      azure_account: spiceadls
      azure_access_key: abc123==
      file_format: csv
```

For a full list of supported files, see the [Object Store File Formats](/components/data-connectors/index.md#object-store-file-formats) documentation.

For more details, see the [Azure Blob Storage Data Connector documentation](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/data-connectors/github).

## Breaking Changes

- **Spice.ai Data Connector:** The key for the Spice.ai Cloud Platform Data Connector has changed from `spiceai` to `spice.ai`. To upgrade, change uses of `from: spiceai:` to `from: spice.ai:`.

- **GitHub Data Connector:** Pull Requests column `login` has been renamed to `author`.

- **CLI SQL REPL:** A terminating semi-colon ';' is now required for each executed SQL block.

- **Spice Runtime hot-reload:** When running the Spice Runtime directly with `spiced`, hot-reload is disabled. Run with `spice run` to enable hot-reload.
