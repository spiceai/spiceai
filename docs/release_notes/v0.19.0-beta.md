# Spice v0.19.0-beta (Sep 30, 2024)


## Highlights in v0.19.0-beta

**Verbosity support for spice & CLI**: 
For both `spice` and the `spice` CLI, users can specify log levels through verbosity flags

```shell
spice -v
spice --very-verbose

spiced --verbose
spiced -vv
```

**Basic embedding chunking**: 

For embedding datasets, users can enable and configure how to chunk input data before creating and using embeddings. This can improve the relevance and precision of embeddings for columns with larger data. Enable chunking in a dataset's `embeddings` config. For example

```yaml
- name: support_tickets
  embeddings:
    - column: conversation_history
      use: awesome_embed
      chunking:
        enabled: true
        desired_chunk_size: 128
        overlap_size: 16
```
