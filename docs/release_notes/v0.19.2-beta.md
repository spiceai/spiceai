# Spice v0.19.2 (Oct 21, 2024)

Spice v0.19.2-beta continues to improve performance and stability of data connectors and data accelerators, further expands TPC-DS coverage, and includes several bug fixes.

## Highlights in v0.19.2

**DataFusion Fixes**: Resolved bugs in DataFusion and DataFusion Table Providers, improving TPC-DS query support and correctness.

**TPC-DS Snapshots**: Extended support for TPC-DS benchmarks with added snapshot tests for validating query plans and result accuracy.

**PostgreSQL Accelerator Beta**: Postgres Data Accelerator has been promoted to [Beta Quality](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/blob/trunk/docs/criteria/accelerators/beta.md)

## Breaking changes

- The `hive_infer_partitions` parameter been changed to `hive_partitioning_enabled`, now defaults to `false` and must be explicitly enabled.
