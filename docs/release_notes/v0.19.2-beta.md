# Spice v0.19.2 (Oct 21, 2024)

Spice v0.19.2-beta continues to improve performance and stability of data connectors and data accelerators, further expands TPC-DS coverage, and includes several bug fixes.

## Highlights in v0.19.2

**DataFusion Fixes**: Resolved bugs in DataFusion and DataFusion Table Providers, improving TPC-DS query support and correctness.

**TPC-DS Snapshots**: Extended support for TPC-DS benchmarks with added snapshot tests for validating query plans and result accuracy.

## Breaking changes
