# Spice.ai v0.1.1-alpha

Announcing the release of Spice.ai v0.1.1-alpha! ðŸ™Œ

This first point release after our launch has been focused on laying the ground work for the next minor version.

Highlights include a new interpretations API that will allow for more intelligent training by enabling users to interpret what certain ranges of time mean. In the future this will be integrated with training to allow the pod to learn based on expert interpretations.

Observations can now be added using a JSON format in addition to the existing CSV format by calling the new dataspace observations API. This leverages the new [JSON processor](https://github.com/spiceai/data-components-contrib/tree/trunk/dataprocessors/json) in the data-components-contrib repository. The JSON processor will by default parse the Spice.ai observation format, but can be extended to accept other formats as well.

The dashboard has also been improved to show the actions taken during a training run, making it easy to visualize the learning process.
