## Notes

New in this release is the ability to compose data "connectors" and data "processors" decoupling the fetching and processing of data inputs. This enables the ability to create a single data processor, for example a CSV processor, with different input data connectors, for example using the "csv" processor with "file", "blob" or "database" connectors.

This introduces a breaking change to the way data connectors are specified in the pod manifest by splitting it into a connector and processor. Previously defined like:

```yaml
- datasource:
  from: coinbase
  name: btcusd
  # Old format
  connector:
    type: csv
    params:
      path: data/btcusd.csv
```

Has been changed to:

```yaml
- datasource:
  from: coinbase
  name: btcusd
  # New format
  data:
    connector:
      name: file
      params:
        path: ../../test/assets/data/csv/COINBASE_BTCUSD, 30.csv
    processor:
      name: csv
```
