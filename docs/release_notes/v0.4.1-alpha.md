## Highlights in v0.4.1-alpha

### Dashboard Observations Datagrid

The dashboard observations datagrid now automatically resizes to the window width, and headers are easier to read, with automatic grouping into dataspaces.

### CLI version detection and upgrade prompt

When it is run, the Spice.ai CLI will now automatically check for new CLI versions once a day maximum.

If it detects a new version, it will print a notification to the console on `spice version`, `spice run` or `spice add` commands prompting the user to upgrade using the new `spice upgrade` command.
