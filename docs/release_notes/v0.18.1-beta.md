# Spice v0.18.1-beta (Sep 23, 2024)

The v0.18.1-beta release continues to improve runtime performance and reliability. Performance for accelerated queries joining multiple datasets has been significantly improved with join push-down support. GraphQL, MySQL, and SharePoint data connectors have better reliability and error handling, and a new Microsoft SQL Server data connector has been introduced. Task History now has fine-grained configuration, including the ability to disable the feature entirely. A new `spice search` CLI command has been added, enabling development-time embeddings-based searches across datasets.

## Highlights in v0.18.1-beta

**Join push-down for accelerations**: Queries to the same accelerator will now push-down joins, significantly improving acceleration performance for queries joining multiple tables.

**Microsoft SQL Server Data Connector**: Use `from: mssql:` to access and accelerate Microsoft SQL Server datasets.

Example `spicepod.yml`:

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: mssql:path.to.my_dataset
    name: my_dataset
    params:
      mssql_connection_string: ${secrets:mssql_connection_string}
```

See the [Microsoft SQL Server Data Connector documentation](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/data-connectors/mssql).

**Task History**: Task History can be configured in the `spicepod.yml`, including the ability to include, or truncate outputs such as the results of a SQL query.

Example `spicepod.yml`:

```yaml
runtime:
  task_history:
    enabled: true
    captured_output: truncated
    retention_period: 8h
    retention_check_interval: 15m
```

See the [Task History Spicepod reference](https://docs.spiceai.org/reference/spicepod#runtimetask_history) for more information on possible values and behaviors.

**Search CLI Command** Use the `spice search` CLI command to perform embeddings-based searches across search configure datasets. Note: Search requires the `ai` feature to be installed.

**Refresh on File Changes**: File Data Connector data refreshes can be configured to be triggered when the source file is modified through a file system watcher. Enable the watcher by adding `file_watcher: enabled` to the acceleration parameters.

Example `spicepod.yml`:

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: file://path/to/my_file.csv
    name: my_file
    acceleration:
      enabled: true
      refresh_mode: full
      params:
        file_watcher: enabled
```

## Breaking Changes

The Query History table `runtime.query_history` has been deprecated and removed in favor of the Task History table `runtime.task_history`. The Task History table tracks tasks across all features such as SQL query, vector search, and AI completion in a unified table.

See the [Task History documentation](https://docs.spiceai.org/reference/task_history).
