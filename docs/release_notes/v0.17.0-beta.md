# Spice v0.17-beta (July 29, 2024)

Announcing the release of Spice.ai v0.17-beta! 🎉

The Spice.ai project has graduated from alpha to beta with this release! Data Connectors graduating from `Alpha` to `Beta` are the `Databricks`, `Spice AI`, `PostgreSQL`, `S3`, `ODBC`, and `MySQL` Data Connectors. While in beta, the focus will be on improving performance and scaling to handle larger datasets.

## Highlights in v0.17-beta

- **Endpoint security with TLS**: All endpoints in Spice.ai can now be secured with TLS. The HTTP, GRPC, Metrics and OpenTelemetry endpoints can be configured to use TLS by specifying the certificate and private key in the [PEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail) format.

Run the Spice.ai runtime with TLS enabled using the `--tls-certificate-file` and `--tls-key-file` flags:

```bash
spice run -- --tls-certificate-file /path/to/cert.pem --tls-key-file /path/to/key.pem
```

Or configure the TLS settings in the `spicepod.yml`:

```yaml
runtime:
  tls:
    certificate_file: /path/to/cert.pem
    key_file: /path/to/key.pem
```

Get started with `TLS` by following the [TLS Sample](https://github.com/spiceai/samples/tree/trunk/tls), or the [TLS Documentation](https://docs.spiceai.org/api/tls).
