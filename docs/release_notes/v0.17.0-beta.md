# Spice v0.17-beta (July 29, 2024)

Announcing the first beta release of Spice.ai OSS! ðŸŽ‰

The core Spice runtime has graduated from alpha to beta! Components, such as Data Connectors and Models, follow independent release milestones. Data Connectors graduating from `alpha` to `beta` include `databricks`, `spiceai`, `postgres`, `s3`, `odbc`, and `mysql`. From beta to 1.0, project will be to on improving performance and scaling to larger datasets.

This release also includes enhanced security with Transport Layer Security (TLS) secured APIs, a new `spice install` CLI command, and several performance and stability improvements.

## Highlights in v0.17-beta

- **Encryption in transit with TLS**: The HTTP, gRPC, Metrics, and OpenTelemetry (OTEL) API endpoints can be secured with TLS by specifying a certificate and private key in [PEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail) format.

Enable TLS using the `--tls-certificate-file` and `--tls-key-file` command-line flags:

```bash
spice run -- --tls-certificate-file /path/to/cert.pem --tls-key-file /path/to/key.pem
```

Or configure in the `spicepod.yml`:

```yaml
runtime:
  tls:
    certificate_file: /path/to/cert.pem
    key_file: /path/to/key.pem
```

Get started with TLS by following the [TLS Sample](https://github.com/spiceai/samples/tree/trunk/tls). For more details see the [TLS Documentation](https://docs.spiceai.org/api/tls).

- **`spice install`**: Running the `spice install` CLI command will download and install the latest version of the runtime.

```bash
spice install
```

- **Improved SQLite and DuckDB compatibility**: The SQLite and DuckDB accelerators support more complex queries and additional data types.

- **Pass through arguments from `spice run` to runtime**: Arguments passed to `spice run` are now passed through to the runtime.

- **Secrets replacement within connection strings**: Secrets are now replaced within connection strings:

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: mysql:my_table
    name: my_table
    params:
      mysql_connection_string: mysql://user:${secrets:mysql_pw}@localhost:3306/db
```

## Breaking Changes

The `odbc` data connector is now optional and has been removed from the released binaries. To use the `odbc` data connector, use the official Spice Docker image or build the Spice runtime from source.

To build Spice from source with the `odbc` feature:

```bash
cargo build --release --features odbc
```

To use the official Spice Docker image from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/spiceai/spiceai):

```bash
# Pull the latest official Spice image
docker pull spiceai/spiceai:latest

# Pull the official v0.17-beta Spice image
docker pull spiceai/spiceai:0.17.0-beta
```
