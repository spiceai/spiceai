# Spice v0.17-beta (July 29, 2024)

Announcing the first beta release of Spice.ai OSS! 🎉

The core Spice runtime has graduated from alpha to beta! Components, such as Data Connectors and Models, follow independent release milestones. Data Connectors graduating from `alpha` to `beta` include `databricks`, `spiceai`, `postgres`, `s3`, `odbc`, and `mysql`. From beta to 1.0, project will be to on improving performance and scaling to larger datasets.

This release also includes enhanced security with Transport Layer Security (TLS) secured APIs, a new `spice install` CLI command, and several performance and stability improvements.

## Highlights in v0.17-beta

- **Encryption in transit with TLS**: The HTTP, gRPC, Metrics, and OpenTelemetry (OTEL) API endpoints can be secured with TLS by specifying a certificate and private key in [PEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail) format.

Enable TLS using the `--tls-certificate-file` and `--tls-key-file` command-line flags:

```bash
spice run -- --tls-certificate-file /path/to/cert.pem --tls-key-file /path/to/key.pem
```

Or configure in the `spicepod.yml`:

```yaml
runtime:
  tls:
    certificate_file: /path/to/cert.pem
    key_file: /path/to/key.pem
```

Get started with TLS by following the [TLS Sample](https://github.com/spiceai/samples/tree/trunk/tls). For more details see the [TLS Documentation](https://docs.spiceai.org/api/tls).

- **`spice install`**: Running the `spice install` CLI command will download and install the latest version of the runtime.

```bash
spice install
```

- **Improved SQLite and DuckDB compatibility**: The SQLite and DuckDB accelerators support more complex queries and additional data types.

- **Pass through arguments from `spice run` to runtime**: Arguments passed to `spice run` are now passed through to the runtime.

- **Secrets replacement within connection strings**: Secrets are now replaced within connection strings:

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: mysql:my_table
    name: my_table
    params:
      mysql_connection_string: mysql://user:${secrets:mysql_pw}@localhost:3306/db
```

## Breaking Changes

The `odbc` data connector is now optional and has been removed from the released binaries. To use the `odbc` data connector, use the official Spice Docker image or build the Spice runtime from source.

To build Spice from source with the `odbc` feature:

```bash
cargo build --release --features odbc
```

To use the official Spice Docker image from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/spiceai/spiceai):

```bash
# Pull the latest official Spice image
docker pull spiceai/spiceai:latest

# Pull the official v0.17-beta Spice image
docker pull spiceai/spiceai:0.17.0-beta
```
