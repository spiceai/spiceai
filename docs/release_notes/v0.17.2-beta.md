# Spice v0.17.2-beta (Aug 26, 2024)

Announcing the release of Spice v0.17.2-beta! üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The v0.17.2-beta release expands type support for data accelerators and introduces optional anonymous usage telemetry. Benchmarking capabilities have been enhanced, and error handling and logging have been improved across data connectors and accelerators.

## Highlights in v0.17.2-beta

**Expanded Type Support for Data Accelerators:** Data accelerators now support a wider range of data types, enabling acceleration of more diverse datasets.

**Anonymous Usage Telemetry:** Optional telemetry has been added to help improve Spice. This feature is enabled by default with a toggle to disable. For details on collected data, see the [telemetry documentation](https://docs.spiceai.org/getting-started/telemetry).

To opt out of telemetry:

1. Using the CLI flag:

    ```bash
    spice run -- --telemetry-enabled false
    ```

2. Adding configuration to `spicepod.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    runtime:
        telemetry:
            enabled: false
    ```

**Improved Benchmarking:** Benchmark tests have been added for various acceleration engines and data connectors and are measured before each release.

**Enhanced Error Handling and Logging:** Improvements have been made to aid in troubleshooting and debugging.

## Breaking Changes

None.
