# Spice v0.13-alpha (May 20, 2024)

The v0.13.0-alpha release significantly improves federated query performance and efficiency with Query Push-Down. Query push-down allows SQL queries to be directly executed by underlying data sources, such as joining tables using the same data connector. Query push-down is supported for all SQL-based and Arrow Flight data connectors. Additionally, runtime metrics, including query duration, collected and accessed in the `spice.runtime.metrics` table. This release also includes a new FTP/SFTP data connector and improved CSV support for the S3 data connector.

## Highlights

- **Federated Query Push-Down \*(#1394):** All SQL and Arrow Flight data connectors support federated query push-down.

- **Runtime Metrics (#1361):** Runtime metric collection can be enabled using the `--metrics` flag and accessed by the `spice.runtime.metrics` table.

- **FTP & SFTP data connector (#1355) (#1399):** Added support for using FTP and SFTP as data sources.

- **Improved CSV support (#1411) (#1414):** S3/FTP/SFTP data connectors support CSV files with expanded CSV options.
