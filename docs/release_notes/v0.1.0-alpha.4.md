# Spice.ai v0.1.0-alpha.4

Announcing the release of Spice.ai v0.1.0-alpha.4! 🎉

We have a project name update. The project will now be referred to as "Spice.ai" instead of "Spice AI" and the project website will be located at [spiceai.org](http://spiceai.org).

This release now uses the new [spicerack.org](https://spicerack.org) AI package registry instead of fetching packages directly from GitHub.

Added support for importing and exporting Spice.ai pods with `spice import` and `spice export` commands.

The CLI been streamlined removing the `pod` command:

- `pod add` changes from `spice pod add <pod path>` to just `spice add <pod path>`
- `pod train` changes from `spice pod train <pod name>` to just `spice train <pod name>`

We've also updated the names of some concepts:

- "DataSources" are now "Dataspaces"
- "Inference" is now "Recommendation"
