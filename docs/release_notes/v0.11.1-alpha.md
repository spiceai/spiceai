# Spice v0.11.1-alpha (Apr 22, 2024)

The v0.11.1-alpha release introduces retention policies for accelerated datasets, native Windows installation support, and integration of catalog and schema settings for the Databricks Spark connector. Several bugs have also been fixed for improved stability.

## Highlights
