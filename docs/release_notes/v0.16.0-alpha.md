# Spice v0.16-alpha (July 22, 2024)

The v0.16-alpha release is the first candidate release for the beta milestone on a path to finalizing the v1.0 developer and user experience. Upgraders should be aware of several breaking changes designed to improve the Secrets configuration experience and to make authoring `spicepod.yml` files more consistent. See the [Breaking Changes](#Breaking Changes) section below for details. Additionally, the Spice Java SDK was released, providing Java developers a simple but powerful native experience to query Spice.

## Highlights in v0.16-alpha

- **Secret Stores**: More than one [Secret Store](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/secret-stores) can now be specified. For example, to configure Spice with both [Environment Variable](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/secret-stores/env) and [AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/secret-stores/aws-secrets-manager) Secret Stores, use the following `secrets` configuration in `spicepod.yaml`:

```yaml
secrets:
  - from: env
    name: env
  - from: aws_secrets_manager:my_secret_name
    name: aws_secret
```

Secrets managed by configured Secret Stores can be referenced in component `params` using the syntax `${<store_name>:<key>}`. E.g.

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: postgres:my_table
    name: my_table
    params:
      pg_host: localhost
      pg_port: 5432
      pg_pass: ${{ env:MY_PG_PASS }}
```

- **Java Client SDK**: The [Spice Java SDK](https://github.com/spiceai/spice-java) has been released for JDK 17 or greater.

- **Federated SQL Query**: Significant stability and reliability improvements have been made to federated SQL query support in most data connectors.

- **ODBC Data Connector**: Providing a specific SQL dialect to query ODBC data sources is now supported using the `sql_dialect` param. For example, when querying Databricks using ODBC, the `databricks` dialect can be specified to ensure compatibility. Read the [ODBC Data Connector documentation](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/data-connectors/odbc) for more details.

## Breaking Changes

- **Secret Stores**: Secret Stores support has been overhauled including required changes to `spicepod.yml` schema. File based secrets stored in the `~/.spice/auth` file are no longer supported. See [Secret Stores Documentation](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/secret-stores) for full reference.

To upgrade Secret Stores, rename any parameters ending in `_key` to remove the `_key` suffix and specify a secret inline via the secret replacement syntax (`${<secret_store>:<key>}`):

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: postgres:my_table
    name: my_table
    params:
      pg_host: localhost
      pg_port: 5432
      pg_pass_key: my_pg_pass
```

to:

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: postgres:my_table
    name: my_table
    params:
      pg_host: localhost
      pg_port: 5432
      pg_pass: ${secrets:my_pg_pass}
```

And ensure the `MY_PG_PASS` environment variable is set.

- **Datasets**: The default value of [`time_format`](https://docs.spiceai.org/reference/spicepod/datasets#time_format) has changed from `unix_seconds` to `timestamp`.

To upgrade:

```yaml
datasets:
  - from:
    name: my_dataset
    # Explicitly define format when not specified.
    time_format: unix_seconds
```

- **HTTP Port**: The default HTTP port has changed from port `3000` to port `8090` to avoid conflicting with frontend apps which typically use the 3000 range. If an SDK is used, upgrade it at the same time as the runtime.

To upgrade and continue using port 3000, run spiced with the `--http` command line argument:

```shell
# Using Dockerfile or spiced directly
spiced --http 127.0.0.1:3000
```

- **HTTP Metrics Port**: The default HTTP Metrics port has changed from port `9000` to `9090` to avoid conflicting with other metrics protocols which typically use port 9000.

To upgrade and continue using port 9000, run spiced with the metrics command line argument:

```shell
# Using Dockerfile or spiced directly
spiced --metrics 127.0.0.1:9000
```

- **GraphQL Data Connector**: `json_path` has been replaced with `json_pointer` to access nested data from the result of the GraphQL query. See the [GraphQL Data Connector](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/data-connectors/graphql) documentation for full details and [RFC-6901 - JSON Pointer](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901).

To upgrade, change:

```yaml
json_path: my.json.path
```

To:

```yaml
json_pointer: my/json/pointer
```

- **Data Connector Configuration**: Consistent connector name prefixing has been applied to connector specific `params` parameters. Prefixed parameter names helps ensure parameters do not collide.

For example, the Databricks data connector specific params are now prefixed with `databricks`:

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: databricks:spiceai.datasets.my_awesome_table # A reference to a table in the Databricks unity catalog
    name: my_delta_lake_table
    params:
      mode: spark_connect
      endpoint: dbc-a1b2345c-d6e7.cloud.databricks.com
      token: MY_TOKEN
```

To upgrade:

```yaml
datasets:
  # Example for Spark Connect
  - from: databricks:spiceai.datasets.my_awesome_table # A reference to a table in the Databricks unity catalog
    name: my_delta_lake_table
    params:
      mode: spark_connect
      databricks_endpoint: dbc-a1b2345c-d6e7.cloud.databricks.com # Now prefixed with databricks
      databricks_token: ${secrets:my_token} # Now prefixed with databricks
```

Refer to the [Data Connector documentation](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/data-connectors) for parameter naming changes in this release.

**Clickhouse Data Connector**: The `clickhouse_connection_timeout` parameter has been renamed to `connection_timeout` as it applies to the client and is not Clickhouse configuration itself.

To upgrade, change:

```yaml
clickhouse_connection_timeout: time
```

To:

```yaml
connection_timeout: time
```
