# Spice v0.16.0-alpha (July 29, 2024)

The v0.16.0-alpha release refreshes the user experience when configuring and using secrets, allowing the configuration of multiple secret stores in a Spicepod.  Additionally, the Spice Java SDK was released, giving developers the ability to query Spice using JDK 17 or greater.  This release also includes improvements to the overall developer experience when configuring spicepods and running Spice for local development.


## Highlights in v0.16.0-beta

- **Secret Stores**: Multiple secret stores can be specified at the top of a Spicepod.  For example to configure Spice with a secret store accessing a local env and AWS secrets manager, add to the `secrets` section in `spicepod.yaml`

```yaml
secrets:
  - from: env
    name: my_env
    params:
      file_path: /path/to/.my_env
  - from: aws_secrets_manager:my_secret_name
    name: aws_secret  
```

Referencing secrets is done in `params` using the syntax `${{<store_name>:<key>}}` where `store_name` is the name of the secret store referenced in the Spicepod.

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: postgres:my_table
    name: my_table
    params:
      pg_host: localhost
      pg_port: 5432
      pg_password: ${{ env:MY_PG_PASS }}
```

- **Java Client SDK**: The [Spice Java SDK](https://github.com/spiceai/spice-java) has been released, providing a way to query Spice from Java applications that use JDK 17 or greater.

- **Federated Query**: The stability and reliability of Federated queries to Data Connectors have been significantly improved.

## Breaking Changes

- **Secret Stores**: The secret store configuration has been refreshed and will need to be updated.  File based secrets stored in the `~/.spice/auth` file are no longer supported.  See [LINK TO DOCUMENTATION HERE](https://docs.spiceai.org) for full reference and details.
- **Data Retention**: The default value of [`time_format`](https://docs.spiceai.org/reference/spicepod/datasets#time_format) has changed from `unix_seconds` to `timestamp`.
- **Spice Runtime**: The default HTTP port has changed from port 3000 to port 8090.
- **Spice Runtime**: The default Metrics port has changed from port 9000 to 9090.
- **GraphQL Data Connector**: `json_path` has been replaced with `json_pointer` when accessing data from the result of the GraphQL query.  See the [GraphQL Data Connector](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/data-connectors/graphql) documentation for full details.
- **Data Connectors UX**: All UX for Data Connectors have been updated for consistency in experience.  Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/data-connectors) for parameter naming changes in this release.
