# Spice v0.15-alpha (July 1, 2024)
The v0.15-alpha release adds support for streaming databases changes with Change Data Capture (CDC) into accelerated tables via a new Debezium connector. ... Configurable retry logic for data refresh ensures data is updated even when the source is temporarily unavailable.

## Highlights
- **Change Data Capture (CDC) via Debezium**: Keep locally accelerated datasets synchronized in real-time with a source database with a new Debezium connector.
- **Data Refresh Retries:** By default, accelerated datasets attempt to retry data refreshes on transient errors. This behavior can be configured using `refresh_retry_enabled` and `refresh_retry_max_attempts`.

Example Spicepod configuration showing how to limit refresh retries to a maximum of 10 attempts

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: eth.blocks
    name: blocks
    acceleration:
      refresh_retry_enabled: true
      refresh_retry_max_attempts: 10
      refresh_check_interval: 30s
```

### Change Data Capture (CDC) via Debezium

Get started with Debezium CDC by following along with the [Debezium CDC Sample](https://github.com/spiceai/samples/tree/trunk/cdc-debezium), read more about the [CDC feature](https://docs.spiceai.org/features/cdc) in Spice or view the [docs for the Debezium data connector](https://docs.spiceai.org/data-connectors/debezium).

Example Spicepod with Debezium CDC:

```yaml
datasets:
- from: debezium:cdc.public.customer_addresses
  name: cdc
  params:
    debezium_transport: kafka
    debezium_message_format: json
    kafka_bootstrap_servers: localhost:19092
  acceleration:
    enabled: true
    engine: duckdb
    mode: file
    refresh_mode: changes
```
