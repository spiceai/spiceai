# Spice v0.15.2-alpha (July 15, 2024)

The v0.15.2-alpha minor release focuses on enhancing stability, performance, and usability.  Improvements to the query rewriting logic for Federated queries has been improved the reliability of the MySQL, Spice AI, PostgreSQL, ODBC, S3, and Databricks connectors.  This release also introduces a preview of Catalog support, including support for Spice AI's data catalog, standalone Unity catalog and Databricks catalog.

## Highlights

**ODBC query JOIN push down:** ODBC datasets that share the same `odbc_connection_string` have improved `JOIN` performance.

**Catalog Providers:** Connect to catalog providers to query all federated tables inside of a catalog. Initial catalog providers supported are Databricks via [Databricks-hosted Unity Catalog](https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog), [Unity Catalog OSS](https://github.com/unitycatalog/unitycatalog/tree/main) and Spice.ai.

**Runtime warns on duplicate resource names:** The runtime now returns a warning when loading for resources that have duplicate names (datasets, views, models, embeddings).
