# Spice v0.15.2-alpha (July 15, 2024)

The v0.15.2-alpha minor release focuses on enhancing stability, performance, and introduces [Catalog Providers](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/catalogs) for streamlined access to Data Catalog tables. Unity Catalog, Databricks Unity Catalog, and the Spice.ai Cloud Platform Catalog are supported in v0.15.2-alpha. The reliability of federated query push-down has also been improved for the MySQL, PostgreSQL, ODBC, S3, Databricks, and Spice.ai Cloud Platform data connectors.

## Highlights in v0.15.2-alpha

**Catalog Providers:** [Catalog Providers](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/catalogs) streamline access to Data Catalog tables. Initial catalog providers supported are [Databricks Unity Catalog](https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog), [Unity Catalog](https://github.com/unitycatalog/unitycatalog/tree/main) and Spice.ai Cloud Platform Catalog.

For example, to configure Spice to connect to `tpch` tables in the Spice.ai Cloud Platform Catalog use the new `catalogs:` section in the `spicepod.yml`:

```yaml
catalogs:
  - name: spiceai
    from: spiceai
    include:
      - tpch.*
```

```bash
sql> show tables
+---------------+--------------+---------------+------------+
| table_catalog | table_schema | table_name    | table_type |
+---------------+--------------+---------------+------------+
| spiceai       | tpch         | region        | BASE TABLE |
| spiceai       | tpch         | part          | BASE TABLE |
| spiceai       | tpch         | customer      | BASE TABLE |
| spiceai       | tpch         | lineitem      | BASE TABLE |
| spiceai       | tpch         | partsupp      | BASE TABLE |
| spiceai       | tpch         | supplier      | BASE TABLE |
| spiceai       | tpch         | nation        | BASE TABLE |
| spiceai       | tpch         | orders        | BASE TABLE |
| spice         | runtime      | query_history | BASE TABLE |
+---------------+--------------+---------------+------------+

Time: 0.001866958 seconds. 9 rows.
```

**ODBC Data Connector Push-Down:** The [ODBC Data Connector](https://docs.spiceai.org/components/data-connectors/odbc) now supports query push-down for joins, improving performance for joined datasets configured with the same `odbc_connection_string`.

**Improved Spicepod Validation** Improved `spicepod.yml` validation has been added, including warnings when loading resources with duplicate names (`datasets`, `views`, `models`, `embeddings`).
