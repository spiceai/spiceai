# Spice.ai v0.2.1-alpha

Announcing the release of Spice.ai v0.2.1-alpha! ðŸšš

This is a point release focused on fixes and improvements to v0.2-alpha.

Highlights include a [new quickstart](https://github.com/spiceai/quickstarts/tree/trunk/tweetrec) that will recommend actions to take based on Twitter data.

This release also supports the ability to specify the fill behavior of missing data in a dataspace. Previously missing data was filled in with the last value (or initial value). While this makes sense for some data, i.e. market prices of a stock or cryptocurrency, it did not make sense for other types of data, i.e. ratings. Now uses can specify a `fill` parameter on a field to determine the behavior. The currently supported fill types are `previous` or `none`. The default is still `previous`.

Example in a manifest:

```yaml
dataspaces:
  - from: twitter
    name: tweets
    fields:
      - name: likes
        fill: none # The new fill parameter
```

## New in this release
