# Spice.ai v0.2.1-alpha

Announcing the release of Spice.ai v0.2.1-alpha! ðŸšš

This is a point release focused on fixes and improvements to v0.2-alpha.

This release supports the ability to specify the fill behavior of missing data in a dataspace. Previously missing data was filled in with the last value (or initial value). While this makes sense for some data, i.e. market prices of a stock or cryptocurrency, it did not make sense for other types of data, i.e. ratings. Now uses can specify a `fill` parameter on a field to determine the behavior. The currently supported fill types are `previous` or `none`. The default is still `previous`.

Example in a manifest:

```yaml
dataspaces:
  - from: twitter
    name: tweets
    fields:
      - name: likes
        fill: none # The new fill parameter
```

## New in this release

- **Adds** the ability to specify the fill behavior of empty values in a dataspace.
- **Simplifies** the release process of Spice.ai to use a single release instead of multiple GitHub releases.
- **Adds** an explicit "development" mode for the Spice.ai runtime. The production mode will turn off the file watcher.
- **Fixes** bug where not setting an epoch in the pod parameters would cause data to not get sent to the AI engine.
