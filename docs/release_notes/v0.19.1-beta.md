# Spice v0.19.1 (Oct 14, 2024)

Spice v0.19.1 brings further performance and stability improvements to the existing set of Data Connectors, as well as performance improvements for File-based connectors (`s3`, `abfs`, `file`, `ftp`, `sftp`) that use Hive-style partitioning.

## Highlights in v0.19.1

**Improved TPC-H and TPC-DS Coverage**: Enhanced support for the TPC-H and TPC-DS benchmarking suites for several connectors and accelerators
**New CLI subcommand**: The `spice` CLI command now includes the `nsql` command which allows querying datasets with natural language
**Improved Github Connector**: The GitHub connector now supports the `array_contains` function in queries
**Embedding Columns inheritance**: If upstream Data sources contain an existing `embeddings` column, Spice will now use that instead of re-calculating them
