# Spice v0.19.1 (Oct 14, 2024)

Spice v0.19.1 brings further performance and stability improvements to data connectors, including improved query push-down for file-based connectors (`s3`, `abfs`, `file`, `ftp`, `sftp`) that use Hive-style partitioning.

## Highlights in v0.19.1

**TPC-H and TPC-DS Coverage**: Expanded coverage for TPC-H and TPC-DS benchmarking suites across accelerators and connectors.

**GitHub Connector Array Filter**: The GitHub connector now supports the `array_contains` function in SQL queries.

**NSQL CLI Command**: A new `spice nsql` CLI command has been added to easily query datasets with natural language from the command line.
