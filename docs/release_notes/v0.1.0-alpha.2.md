## New in this release

- **Fixes** an issue where /observations API was not returning all observations correctly
- **Added** the ability to POST new local observations to the /observations API
- **Added** a new AI algorithm (Deep Q-Learning) along with a common interface for future algorithms
- **Added** the `spice train` command which supports starting the runtime, training a specific manifest, then shutting down
- **Added** an E2E test that exercises the main training loop scenario using `spice train`
