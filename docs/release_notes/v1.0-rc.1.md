# Spice v1.0-rc.1 (Oct 14, 2024)

Spice v1.0-rc.1 brings further performance and stability improvements to the existing set of Data Connectors, as well as performance improvements for File-based connectors (`s3`, `abfs`, `file`, `ftp`, `sftp`) that use Hive-style partitioning.

## Highlights in v1.0-rc.1

**Improved TPC-H and TPC-DS Coverage**: Enhanced support for the TPC-H and TPC-DS benchmarking suites for several connectors and accelerators
**New CLI subcommand**: The `spice` CLI command now includes the `nsql` command which allows you to query your datasets using natural language
**Improved Github Connector**: The GitHub connector now supports the `array_contains` function in queries
**Embedding Columns inheritance**: If your upstream Data sources contain an existing `embeddings` column, Spice will now use that instead of re-calculating them
