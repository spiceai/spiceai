# Spice v0.17.1-beta (Aug 5, 2024)

The v0.17.1-beta minor release focuses on enhancing stability, performance, and usability. The Flight interface now supports the `GetSchema` API and `s3`, `ftp`, `sftp`, `http`, `https`, and `delta_lake` data connectors have added support for a `client_timeout` parameter.

## Highlights in v0.17.1-beta

**Flight API GetSchema:** The [`GetSchema`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html) API is now supported by the Flight interface. The schema of a dataset can be retrieved using `GetSchema` with the `PATH` or `CMD` FlightDescriptor types. The `CMD` FlightDescriptor type is used to get the schema of an arbitrary SQL query as the CMD bytes. The `PATH` FlightDescriptor type is used to retrieve the schema of a dataset.

**Client Timeout:** A `client_timeout` parameter has been added for Data Connectors: `ftp`, `sftp`, `http`, `https`, and `delta_lake`. When defined, the client timeout configures Spice to stop waiting for a response from the data source after the specified duration. The default timeout is 30 seconds.

```yaml
datasets:
  - from: ftp://remote-ftp-server.com/path/to/folder/
    name: my_dataset
    params:
      file_format: csv
      # Example client timeout
      client_timeout: 30s
      ftp_user: my-ftp-user
      ftp_pass: ${secrets:my_ftp_password}
```

## Breaking Changes

TLS is now required to be explicitly enabled. Enable TLS on the command line using `--tls-enabled true`:

```bash
spice run -- --tls-enabled true --tls-certificate-file /path/to/cert.pem --tls-key-file /path/to/key.pem
```

Or in the `spicepod.yml` with `enabled: true`:

```yaml
runtime:
  tls:
    # TLS explicitly enabled
    enabled: true
    certificate_file: /path/to/cert.pem
    key_file: /path/to/key.pem
```
