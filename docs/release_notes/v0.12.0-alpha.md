# Spice v0.12-alpha (Apr 29, 2024)

The v0.12-alpha release introduces Clickhouse and Apache Spark data connectors, adds support for limiting refresh data periods for temporal datasets, and includes upgraded Spice Client SDKs compatible with Spice OSS.

## Highlights

- **Clickhouse data connector**: Use [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com) as a data source with the `clickhouse:` scheme.

- **Apache Spark Connect data connector**: Use Apache [Spark Connect](https://spark.apache.org/spark-connect/) connections as a data source using the `spark:` scheme.

- **Refresh data window**: Limit accelerated dataset data refreshes to the specified window, as a duration from now configuration setting, for faster and more efficient refreshes.

- **ODBC data connector**: Use ODBC connections as a data source using the `odbc:` scheme. The ODBC data connector is currently optional and not included in default builds. It can be conditionally compiled using the `odbc` cargo feature when building from source.

- **Spice Client SDK Support**: The official Spice SDKs have been upgraded with support for Spice OSS.

  - [spice.js v2.0.0](https://github.com/spiceai/spice.js/releases/tag/v2.0.0)
  - [gospice v6.0.0](https://github.com/spiceai/gospice/releases/tag/v6.0.0)
  - [spicepy v2.0.0](https://github.com/spiceai/spicepy/releases/tag/v2.0.0)
  
## Breaking Changes
- **Refresh interval:** The `refresh_interval` acceleration setting and been changed to `refresh_check_interval` to make it clearer it is the check versus the data interval.
