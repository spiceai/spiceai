## Highlights in v0.7-alpha

[Rust DataFusion Engine](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion): We're excited to introduce our new Rust Datafusion engine. This powerful, extensible query execution engine enables high-performance query execution against data sources of all sizes.

Support for locally accelerated data access using local Apache Arrow or [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) as a data back-end.

## New in this release

- **Adds** support for Dremio as a data source
- **Adds** support for OpenTelemetry data collection on the edge
- **Adds** support for two data back-end at the edge, choose between DuckDB or an in-memory data store to accelerate your data queries
- **Adds** dynamically reloading Spicepod from the filesystem
