# Spice.ai v0.3-alpha

We are excited to announce the release of Spice.ai v0.3-alpha! ðŸŽ‰

This release adds support for ingestion, automatic encoding, and training of categorical data, enabling many more datasets and use-cases beyond just numerical measurements. For example, perhaps you want to train on t-shirt size, a category of discrete data values, such as Small, Medium, and Large. The v0.3 engine now supports this and automatically encodes the string values into numerical values that machine learning can use. Also included is a preview of data visualizations in the dashboard, which is helpful for developers as they author Spicepods and data streams. 

A special acknowledgment to @sboorlagadda, who submitted the first Spice.ai community feature contribution, adding the ability to list pods from the CLI with the new `spice pods list` command. Thank you, @sboorlagadda!!!

## Highlights in v0.3-alpha

### Categorical data

In the first release, the runtime and AI engine only supported ingesting numerical data. In v0.2, tagged data is accepted and automatically encoded into fields available for learning. In this release, v0.3, categorical data is also accepted and automatically encoded into fields available for learning. This is a *breaking change* with the format of the manifest changing to separate numerical measurements and categorical data.

Pre-v0.3, the manifest author specified numerical data using the fields node.

v0.3, numerical data is now specified under "measurements" and categorical data under "categories". E.g.

```yaml
dataspaces:
  - from: event
    name: stream
    measurements:
      - name: duration
        selector: length_of_time
        fill: none
      - name: guest_count
        selector: num_guests
        fill: none
    categories:
      - name: event_type
        values:
          - dinner
          - party
      - name: target_audience
        values:
          - employees
          - investors
    tags:
      - tagA
      - tagB
```

### Data visualizations preview

A top piece of community feedback was the ability to visualize data. After first running Spice.ai, we'd often hear from developers, "how do I see the data?". A preview of data visualizations is now included in the dashboard on the pod page.

### Listing pods
Once the Spice.ai runtime has started, you can view the loaded pods on the dashboard and fetch them via API call [localhost:8000/api/v0.1/pods](http://localhost:8000/api/v0.1/pods). To make it even easier, we've added the ability to list them via the CLI with the new `spice pods list` command, which shows the list of pods and their manifest paths.

### Coinbase data connector

A new data connector is included, enabling the streaming of live market ticker prices from Coinbase Pro. Enable it by specifying the coinbase data connector and providing a list of Coinbase Pro product ids. A new sample which demonstrates is also available with its associated Spicepod available from the spicerack.org registry. Get it with `spice add samples/trader`

## New in this release
- **Adds** support for ingesting, encoding, and training on categorical data. v0.3 uses one-hot-encoding.
- **Changes**  Spicepod manifest fields node to measurements and add the categories node. See docs for more information.
- **Adds** the ability to select a field from the source data and map it to a different field name in the dataspace. See an example in docs.
- **Adds** support for JSON content type when fetching from the /observations API. Previously, only CSV was supported.
- **Adds** a preview version of data visualizations to the dashboard. The grid has several limitations, one of which is it currently cannot be resized.
- **Adds** the ability to select which learning algorithm to use via the CLI, the API, and specified in the Spicepod manifest. Possible choices are currently "vpg", Vanilla Policy Gradient and "dql", Deep Q-Learning. Shout out to @corentin-pro, who added this feature on his second day on the team!
- **Adds** the ability to list loaded pods with the CLI command spice pods list
- **Adds** a new data connector for Coinbase Pro market prices
- **Fixes** bug where the /observations endpoint was not providing fully qualified field names.
- **Fixes** issue where debugging messages were printed when using spice add.
