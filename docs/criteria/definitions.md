## Major Bug

A major bug is classified as a bug that:

- Renders the component completely inoperable (i.e. all queries on an accelerator fail, accelerator loading fails, all connector queries fail, etc), or;
- Causes data inconsistency errors, or;
- A bug that occurs in more than one instance of the component (i.e. more than one accelerator, more than one connector), or;
- A bug that is high impact or likely to be experienced in common use cases, and there is no viable workaround.

## Minor Bug

A minor bug is any bug that cannot be classified as a major bug.
