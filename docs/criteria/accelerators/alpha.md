# Spice.ai OSS Data Accelerators - Alpha Release Criteria

This document defines the set of criteria that is required before a data accelerator is considered to be of Alpha quality.

All criteria must be met for the accelerator to be considered Alpha, with exceptions only permitted in some circumstances (e.g. it would be technically infeasible to add a feature/fix a bug for a particular accelerator).

## Alpha Quality Accelerators

| Accelerator | Alpha Quality | DRI Sign-off |
| - | - | - |
| Arrow      | ❌ |  |
| DuckDB     | ❌ |  |
| SQLite     | ❌ |  |
| PostgreSQL | ❌ |  |
