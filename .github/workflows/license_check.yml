name: Check for forbidden licenses

# Checks for any forbidden/copyleft licenses using their SPDX identifiers
# (https://spdx.org/licenses/)

# Listings of packages and their licenses are generated by different tools,
# one for each language used in the project:
#
# - Go modules use go-licenses (github.com/google/go-licenses)
# - Python packages use pip-licenses (https://github.com/raimon49/pip-licenses)
# - Node packages use NPM License Checker (https://www.npmjs.com/package/license-checker)
#
# Each license listing is checked against a regex in FORBIDDEN_LICENSE_CHECK to
# ensure no forbidden licenses are present.  If any are detected, the build is failed.

# List of copyleft licenses derived from Blue Oak Council Guide to Copyleft
# (https://blueoakcouncil.org/copyleft)

# List of forbidden licenses derived from Google License Classifier
