## What is Spice?

**Spice** is a small, portable runtime that provides developers with a unified SQL query interface to locally materialize, accelerate, and query datasets sourced from any database, data warehouse, or data lake.

üì£ Read the [Spice.ai OSS announcement blog post](https://blog.spiceai.org/posts/2024/03/28/adding-spice-the-next-generation-of-spice.ai-oss/).

Spice makes it easy to build data-driven and data-intensive applications by streamlining the use of data and machine learning (ML) in software.

The Spice runtime is written in Rust and leverages industry leading technologies like Apache DataFusion, Apache Arrow, Apache Arrow Flight, and DuckDB.

## Why Spice?

Spice makes querying data by SQL across one or more data sources simple and fast. Easily co-locate a managed working set of data with your application or ML, locally accelerated in-memory with Arrow, with SQLite/DuckDB, or with an attached database like PostgreSQL for high-performance, low-latency queries. Accelerated engines run in your infrastructure giving you flexibility and control over price and performance.

### Example Use-Cases

**1. Faster applications and frontends.** Accelerate and co-locate datasets with applications and frontends, to serve more concurrent queries and users with faster page loads and data updates.

**2. Faster dashboards, analytics, and BI.** Faster, more responsive dashboards without massive compute costs.

**3. Faster data pipelines, machine learning training and inferencing.** Co-locate datasets in pipelines where the data is needed to minimize data-movement and improve query performance.

**4. Easily query many data sources.** Federated SQL query across databases, data warehouses, and data lakes using [Data Connectors](https://docs.spiceai.org/data-connectors).

### Supported Data Connectors

Currently supported data connectors for upstream datasets. More coming soon.

### Intelligent Applications

Spice enables developers to build both data _and_ AI-driven applications by co-locating data _and_ ML models with applications. Read more about the vision to enable the development of [intelligent AI-driven applications](https://docs.spiceai.org/intelligent-applications).

‚ö†Ô∏è **DEVELOPER PREVIEW** Spice is under active **alpha** stage development and is not intended to be used in production until its **1.0-stable** release. If you are interested in running Spice in production, please get in touch so we can support you (See Connect with us below).

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart (Local Machine)

https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/assets/88671039/85cf9a69-46e7-412e-8b68-22617dcbd4e0

### macOS, Linux, and WSL

**Step 1.** Install the Spice CLI:

```bash
curl https://install.spiceai.org | /bin/bash
```

Or using `brew`:

```bash
brew install spiceai/spiceai/spice
```

**Step 2.** Initialize a new Spice app with the `spice init` command:

```bash
spice init spice_qs
```

A `spicepod.yaml` file is created in the `spice_qs` directory. Change to that directory:

```bash
cd spice_qs
```

**Step 3.** Start the Spice runtime:

```bash
spice run
```

Example output will be shown as follows:

```bash
Spice.ai runtime starting...
Using latest 'local' runtime version.
2024-02-21T06:11:56.381793Z  INFO runtime::http: Spice Runtime HTTP listening on 127.0.0.1:3000
2024-02-21T06:11:56.381853Z  INFO runtime::flight: Spice Runtime Flight listening on 127.0.0.1:50051
2024-02-21T06:11:56.382038Z  INFO runtime::opentelemetry: Spice Runtime OpenTelemetry listening on 127.0.0.1:50052
```

The runtime is now started and ready for queries.

**Step 4.** In a new terminal window, add the `spiceai/quickstart` Spicepod. A Spicepod is a package of configuration defining datasets and ML models.

```bash
spice add spiceai/quickstart
```

The `spicepod.yaml` file will be updated with the `spiceai/quickstart` dependency.

```yaml
version: v1beta1
kind: Spicepod
name: PROJECT_NAME
dependencies:
  - spiceai/quickstart
```

The `spiceai/quickstart` Spicepod will add a `taxi_trips` data table to the runtime which is now available to query by SQL.

```bash
2024-02-22T05:53:48.222952Z  INFO runtime: Loaded dataset: taxi_trips
2024-02-22T05:53:48.223101Z  INFO runtime::dataconnector: Refreshing data for taxi_trips
```

**Step 5.** Start the Spice SQL REPL:

```bash
spice sql
```

The SQL REPL inferface will be shown:

```
Welcome to the interactive Spice.ai SQL Query Utility! Type 'help' for help.

show tables; -- list available tables
sql>
```

Enter `show tables;` to display the available tables for query:

```
sql> show tables
+------------+
| table_name |
+------------+
| taxi_trips |
+------------+

Query took: 0.007505084 seconds. 1/1 rows displayed.
```

Enter a query to display the longest taxi trips:

```
sql> SELECT trip_distance_mi, total_amount FROM taxi_trips ORDER BY trip_distance_mi DESC LIMIT 10;
```

Output:

```
+------------------+--------------+
| trip_distance_mi | total_amount |
+------------------+--------------+
| 191.9            | 3.0          |
| 189.2            | 63.0         |
| 163.8            | 93.64        |
| 122.4            | 160.0        |
| 104.0            | 3.0          |
| 69.7             | 213.58       |
| 64.8             | 280.83       |
| 60.0             | 350.12       |
| 53.9             | 0.0          |
| 53.3             | 5.33         |
+------------------+--------------+

Query took: 0.002458976 seconds
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Runtime Container Deployment

Using the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/spiceai/spiceai) locally:

```bash
docker pull spiceai/spiceai
```

In a Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
from spiceai/spiceai:latest
```

Using Helm:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai.git
cd spiceai
helm upgrade --install spiceai ./deploy/chart
```

## üèéÔ∏è Next Steps

You can use any number of predefined datasets available from Spice.ai in the Spice runtime.

A list of publically available datasets from Spice.ai can be found here: https://[docs.spice.ai/building-blocks/datasets](https://docs.spice.ai/building-blocks/datasets).

In order to access public datasets from Spice, you will first need to create an account with Spice.ai by selecting the free tier membership.

Navigate to [spice.ai](https://spice.ai/) and create a new account by clicking on Try for Free.

<img width="500" alt="spiceai_try_for_free-1" src="https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/assets/112157037/27fb47ed-4825-4fa8-94bd-48197406cfaa">

After creating an account, you will need to create an app in order to create to an API key.

![create_app-1](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/assets/112157037/d2446406-1f06-40fb-8373-1b6d692cb5f7)

You will now be able to access datasets from Spice.ai. For this demonstration, we will be using the Spice.ai/eth.recent_blocks dataset.

**Step 1.** Log in and authenticate from the command line using the `spice login` command. A pop up browser window will prompt you to authenticate:

```bash
spice login
```

**Step 2.** Initialize a new project and start the runtime:

```bash
# Initialize a new Spice app
spice init spice_app

# Change to app directory
cd spice_app

# Start the runtime
spice run
```

**Step 3.** Configure the dataset:

In a new terminal window, configure a new dataset using the `spice dataset configure` command:

```bash
spice dataset configure
```

You will be prompted to enter a name. Enter a name that represents the contents of the dataset

```bash
dataset name: (spice_app) eth_recent_blocks
```

Enter the description of the dataset:

```
description: eth recent logs
```

Enter the location of the dataset:

```bash
from: spice.ai/eth.recent_blocks
```

Select `y` when prompted whether to accelerate the data:

```bash
Locally accelerate (y/n)? y
```

You should see the following output from your runtime terminal:

```bash
2024-02-21T22:49:10.038461Z  INFO runtime: Loaded dataset: eth_recent_blocks
```

**Step 4.** In a new terminal window, use the Spice SQL REPL to query the dataset

```bash
spice sql
```

```sql
SELECT number, size, gas_used from eth_recent_blocks LIMIT 10;
```

The output displays the results of the query along with the query execution time:

```bash
+----------+--------+----------+
| number   | size   | gas_used |
+----------+--------+----------+
| 19281345 | 400378 | 16150051 |
| 19281344 | 200501 | 16480224 |
| 19281343 | 97758  | 12605531 |
| 19281342 | 89629  | 12035385 |
| 19281341 | 133649 | 13335719 |
| 19281340 | 307584 | 18389159 |
| 19281339 | 89233  | 13391332 |
| 19281338 | 75250  | 12806684 |
| 19281337 | 100721 | 11823522 |
| 19281336 | 150137 | 13418403 |
+----------+--------+----------+

Query took: 0.004057791 seconds
```

You can experiment with the time it takes to generate queries when using non-accelerated datasets. You can change the acceleration setting from `true` to `false` in the datasets.yaml file.
